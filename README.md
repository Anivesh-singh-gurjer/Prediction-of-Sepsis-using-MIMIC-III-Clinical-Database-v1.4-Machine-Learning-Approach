# Prediction-of-Sepsis-using-MIMIC-III-Clinical-Database-v1.4-Machine-Learning-Approach
This repository houses the codebase for a machine-learning project to predict sepsis using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database v1.4. Leveraging over 40 carefully selected clinical features extracted from the dataset, our machine-learning pipeline employs advanced algorithms to forecast the onset of sepsis in patients.
