# Prediction-of-Sepsis-using-MIMIC-III-Clinical-Database-v1.4-Machine-Learning-Approach
This repository houses the codebase for a machine-learning project to predict sepsis using the MIMIC-III Clinical Database v1.4. Leveraging over 40 carefully selected clinical features extracted from the dataset, our machine-learning pipeline employs advanced algorithms to forecast the onset of sepsis in patients. Through meticulous data preprocessing, model training, and validation processes, we aim to develop a robust predictive model that can assist healthcare practitioners in early detection and intervention. Continuously refining our methods by benchmarking against established literature and adopting best practices in machine learning, we strive to contribute to the advancement of sepsis prediction and improve patient outcomes.

Key Features:
Feature extraction from MIMIC-III Clinical Database v1.4 for sepsis prediction.
